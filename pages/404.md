Round and round, round we go

Where it stops? Nobody knows it

Side to side baby, back and forth

God above and the devil below him

You got your reasons and I got my wants

Still got that feeling, but I'm too old to die young now

Too old to die young now

Above or below the ground

Yes, too old to die young now

Still the good lord might lay me down
